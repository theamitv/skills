# Class → Hooks Migrator

## Phase 1 — THINK
This migration's real risk isn't syntax — it's that `componentDidUpdate` and `useEffect` have different mental models, and a naive conversion silently introduces stale closures or infinite re-render loops.
- For every class component being converted, list its lifecycle methods and, critically, what each one *depends on reading* (props/state) at the time it runs
- Specifically check `componentDidUpdate` logic that does conditional work based on comparing prev/current props or state — this needs to become a `useEffect` with a carefully chosen dependency array, not a blind "run every update"
- Check for `this.instance` variables that aren't state (timers, subscriptions, mutable refs) — these map to `useRef`, not `useState`, and mixing them up is a common bug source
- Flag any component using legacy lifecycle methods (`componentWillReceiveProps`, `componentWillMount`) — these need a real redesign, not a mechanical hook swap

## Phase 2 — PLAN
For each component, show before starting:
1. State → `useState`/`useReducer` mapping (recommend `useReducer` if there are more than ~3 interdependent state values, since that's where `useState` sprawl gets buggy)
2. Lifecycle → `useEffect` mapping, with the dependency array explicitly reasoned about per effect, not left as an afterthought
3. Instance variables → `useRef` mapping
4. Any behavior that's genuinely ambiguous to convert safely (e.g., subtle timing in `componentDidUpdate`) flagged for the user to confirm intent before converting

## Phase 3 — EXECUTE
- Convert one component at a time, not a batch find-and-replace
- Write `useEffect` dependency arrays that match actual reads inside the effect (don't suppress the exhaustive-deps lint rule to make it "work" — that's how stale closures get reintroduced)
- Preserve exact rendered output and prop API — this is a mechanics change, not a behavior change, unless explicitly asked otherwise

## Verification checklist
- [ ] No stale-closure bugs (test with rapid state changes / interactions)
- [ ] No infinite re-render loops (check dependency arrays against actual `useEffect` body reads)
- [ ] Component's external prop API and rendered output unchanged

## Security Rules (never violate)
- **No `curl | bash`** — Use only `npm install` / `npm uninstall` for package management.
- **No `eval`** — Never use `eval` or equivalent dynamic code execution.
- **No file operations outside project** — Never read, write, or modify files outside the project directory.
- **No secrets in output** — Never print API keys, tokens, or credentials in reports or logs.
- **Backup before destructive ops** — Always create a git commit or stash before rewriting components.
- **Validate before write** — Validate JSX/TSX syntax compiles before declaring a component done.
- **No silent dependency installs** — Tell the user which packages will be installed and get implicit confirmation before running `npm install`.
- **Never change prop API or rendered output** — This is a mechanics change, not a behavior change. Preserve exact prop types and rendered DOM.
